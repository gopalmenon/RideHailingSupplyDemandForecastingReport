\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.





\usepackage{url}
\usepackage[fleqn]{amsmath}
\usepackage{algorithm,algpseudocode}
\usepackage{mathtools}
\usepackage{gensymb}
\usepackage{csquotes}
\usepackage{placeins}
\usepackage{siunitx}
\usepackage{multirow}
% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multilines. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Background }

Didi Chuxing is the leading ride hailing company in China and processes over 11 million trips, plans over 9 billion routes and collects over 50TB of data per day. They organized a worldwide algorithm challenge in the year 2016 \cite{DidiPage} for forecasting ride supply and demand. 

\section{Project Scope}
The project team will use the 2016 Didi algorithm competition dataset to forecast taxi trip supply, demand, and expected fare for any given date, time, and location using regression models explicated in the Data Mining 2017 Spring semester at the School of Computing of the University of Utah. The accuracy of the forecast will be evaluated using an average forecast error metric.

\section{Current Progress}

\subsection{Data format conversion}
In order to run the regression models, the categorical values in the Didi algorithm competition dataset needed to be converted into a regression friendly format. Depending on the type of categorical value, the new values are lists that consist of $0$ values when the category is not present in an order and $1$ or a count when the category is present in the order.

\subsection{Data format details}
We have converted the data into a format that can be used by the regression models. The input to the regression consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item An order key, comprised of the categorical values for start district, destination district and order time
 \item An order value consisting of  
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item Traffic and points of interest for the start and destination districts
 \item Weather at the time of the order
 \item The value that needs to be predicted, which is the median order price or the number of orders
 \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

With the input data created, we have started experimenting with multiple regression models.
\subsection{Data Size}
We have $1.3$ million rows in our training data consisting of ride hailing orders. When we took into consideration, only those orders where the start and end districts have data for traffic and places of interest, the number of training rows were reduced to $921,000$.
\section{Approaches Tried}

We started using scikit-learn \cite{sklearn}, the Python Machine Learning library, for running regressions, as it seemed to offer many regression models that can be fine tuned using hyper-parameters.

\subsection{What did not work}

The first scikit-learn regression model we tried was Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression as we wanted to see how the basic regression model would do in comparison with future models we planned to try. It was to be a sort of baseline for comparison. It did not return a result after running overnight and we realized that most scikit-learn regression models like OLS, Ridge and Lasso will only work \cite{choose} when the number of samples is less than $100,000$.  For cases where the number of samples is more than this number, the only regression model available was the one using Stochastic Gradient Descent. We used this model and gave it the entire training set. The regression did finish running, but the results were wildly inaccurate with a mean squared error of $\approx10^{35}$. We then discovered that districts in all orders did not have data for traffic and places of interest. We then removed the orders without this data, but the results were still not accurate. 

\subsection{What Worked}
We used the scikit-learn Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) regression model after removing weather, traffic and points of interest from the regression input. With this data format, our mean squared error dropped to $223$ from a value of $\approx10^{35}$. This was achieved with default hyper-parameters. With $5$-fold cross-validation, the error further dropped to $182$.

The results of the initial regression can be found below.
    \begin{table}[!h] 
    \centering
    \caption{Initial Regression Results}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
      \hline
   Predicted Variable  & Mean Squared Error \\
      \hline      
      Number of Orders&   $\num[group-separator={,}]{182.777}$ \\
      \hline      
      Order Price&    $\num[group-separator={,}]{518.663}$    \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
For predicting number of orders, approximately $13.76\%$ of the values were determined to be significant, meaning the coefficient for the value was greater than 1 or the value was less than -1, in predicting the number of orders.  The majority, $\approx 92.12\%$, of the significant values used to predict the number of orders were part of the time categories. Meaning the time of the day had the most significant impact on the number of orders.\\
For predicting order price, approximately $23.90\%$ of the values were determined to be significant in predicting the order price. The majority, $\approx 77.55\%$, of the significant values used to predict the number of orders were part of the district categories. Meaning the districts, both start and destination, had the most significant impact on the order price.
    
\section{Future Work}

We plan to experiment with other models of regression including Ridge, Lasso, and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit. Since scikit-learn cannot be used for this purpose, due to the limitation of the amount of data it can process, we will need to use other libraries or code our own solutions. During review of the regression model output the project team may adjust the input values by eliminating or adding variables that result in increased accuracy. We may also eliminate variables that have minimal impact.
